:warning: This is an experimental project, and is not ready for general use. **We do not recommend running this on production sites.**

## Prerequisites

[WordPress 5.0 or greater](https://wordpress.org/download/) and [WooCommerce 3.5.0 or greater](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) should be installed prior to activating the WooCommerce Gutenberg Emails feature plugin.

For better debugging, it's also recommended you add `define( 'SCRIPT_DEBUG', true );` to your wp-config. This will load the unminified version of all libraries, and specifically the development build of React.
